# Design web pages with CSS

## How to custamize your page

### In order to make your page feels a life and readable:

You have to start custamizing it, color it and organize it
To do so:

## 1. First:

There is a several ways to applay the css on your page by using:

#### 1. Inline CSS:
The CSS is written after rvery tag in the HTML file 

#### 2. Internal CSS:
The CSS is written at the end of the html file which is better than the first method 

#### 3. External CSS:
The CSS is written in a completly separate file and the the HTML file is linked to,
This method is considered the best and the most recommanded


You have to link your HTML with the CSS file it by typing:
`<link rel="StyleSheet" href="nameofthefile.css">`

After creating the CSS file and linking the html file to it you will have ***THE POWER OF EDITS***
Their is lots of options such as:

- Changing the color of the background ex: `body {background-color: rgb(255, 233, 233);}` you may choose between 3 methods of coloring:
  - RGB values as *in the example*
  - hex codes
  - color names

- changing the font color ex: `tagname {color: rgb(255, 233, 233);}`

- changing font of specific text ex: `tagname {font-family: monospace}`

- And alots more...

## 2. Refering to objects:
The tag name isn't the only way to css an item also if you wanted to apply changes to
a specific item then use one of these:

### Attributes:

- ID:
Like the id you have, you can give items in your HTML a specific ID,
ID's cannot be applied to more than one item, you can call the item by the ID by Typing:
`#IDname {the css command}`
- Class:
the class is really similar to ID but it can Be applied to several items and the command will do for all
To use it type `.classname {the css command}`
