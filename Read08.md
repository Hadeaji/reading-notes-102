# Operators and Loops:

First lets talk about Operators signs:

##### - `==` Equal to: used to compare 2 values to see if they are matchs
##### - `!=` Not Equal to: used to compare 2 values if they are not matching
##### - `===` Strict Equal to: used to compare 2 values if they are matching in data type and value
##### - `!==` Strict Not Equal to: used to compare 2 values if they are not matching in data type and value
##### - `>` Greater Than
##### - `<` Less Than
##### - `>=` Greater Than or Equal
##### - `<=` Less Than or Equal

### How do you use Operators:

#### Logical Operators

##### -`&&` Logical And values on both sides have to be true in order to outputs true
##### -`||` Logical Or one value from its sides have to be true in order to outputs true
##### -`!` Logical Not Reverses The value output

### How does Loops Work:
##### - A For Loop used when you want to run the loop for specific number
##### - A While Loop When you dont know how much times the code will run, it will stops when codition = false
##### - Do While Loop It will run at least one time even if it was false

###### The `var = 0` in the pic is a variable called initializer
###### The section in center called codition thats as long as it is true the loop reamains
###### the last section is the update which happen with every loop
