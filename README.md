# Growth mindset in my own words 

### Growth mindset is the the abbilty to improve to develop yourself in the learning phase
### To be overall a better version of yourself and acheive higher grades or goals than you
### Would do while you are fixed mind afixed mind bounded to the groud sees every higher mind as a threat
### Refuses to grow and istead wishes collapsing to others so they be on their level




## To keep myself awar and try to keep my mindset growing:  

### 1. First 
- When i face a challenge and my brain says imposible i say to him challenge accepted

### 2. Second 
- I have to try my best to the last minute and if i didn't i am worthless

### 3. Thired 
- Being sarcastic :smile: is the cooling system of my mind when facing hard solving problems

# It works for me but what about you
