# Text Editors
### First of all What is the Text Editor
The text editor are programes we use to write code easier and faster than using the computer build-in software
##### Unlike the build-in software the Text Editors offer assistant to the user such as:
#### 1. Auto fill:
- Sugggest Auto filling for the user depends on what he's writing
- Auto end the commands then giving you the space to write in between
#### 2. Handling errors:
- Notify you about errors and tells you the problems so you dont have to figure it out by yourself
#### 3. Looking:
- Have a beeter look and it is easier to the eye to look at, also can be custmized and changed in color and theme
#### 4. Testing results:
- You can easily view your work results and make decisions

### Overall Experience:
using Text Editors is much faster and healthier to coders and improve the quality of life to them

#### Some Text Editors i consider:
There is alot of good Text Editors out there such as Sublime Text, Brackets, NotePad++, Visual Studio Code and atom.

But i myself prefare **Visual Studio Code** because i have some clue about it and it matshs mystyle the most
i also may try Atom later
