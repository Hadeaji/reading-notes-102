# Computer Architecture and Logic

> ### What Makes A Computer A Computer?

The computer is a tool or a machine but what makes it differ from other machines
Other machine help human in work or physical activity while computer helps in the thinking activity
like solving problems or finding answers, in order to it have to:

###### 1. take input: from screens or contolers

###### 2. store info: stores the commands from the inputs

###### 3. process it: define it and process it then store it again 

###### 4. Output results: take results from storage through output devices such as screens or speakers

Wires and Circuits carry computer information, But How does that work?
When the elcticity moves in the wire the computer describe it as yes and if not it is no
using the binary system the yes = 1 and no = 0 and it calls the result a bit

### But how the binary system can represnt:

#### 1. numbers: 
the binary system Converts normal numbers to binary systen thought Algorithm 

  1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
----|---|---|---|---|---|---
 64 | 32| 16| 8 | 4 | 2 | 1

And bigger number can be repreast by more bits, since the computer have a huge number of Circuits it can store more information

#### 2. Text:
same for numbers letters can be given numbers depends on their alphabetic order
then the number is converted to binary or The opposite

#### 3. images:
images consist of huge number of pixels and the one pixel have a specific color number like in the rgb system 

etc

### in order to reduce the number of Circuits we used the gates:

1. And gate: when the 2 inputs that are given to it are 1 it gives one
2. or gate: if one of the inputs that are given to it are 1 it gives one
3. not gate: recers the input it gets
and there is the nand, nor and xor which are combain of the the 3
and with lots of these we can create more complex Circuit in order to reduce the number of Circuit needed to do one procedure

#### Thats a basic Introductin About how computers work I hope you liked it
