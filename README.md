# Growth mindset in my own words 
### Growth mindset is the the abbilty to improve to develop yourself in the learning phase
### To be overall a better version of yourself and acheive higher grades or goals than you
### Would do while you are fixed mind afixed mind bounded to the groud cant grow or produce, a casual....






## To keep myself awar and try to keep my mindset growing:  

### First 
When i face a challenge and my brain says imposible i say to him challenge accepted

### Second 
I have to try my best to the last minute and if i didn't i am worthless

### Thired 
Being sarcastic is the cooling system of my mind when facing hard solving problems

# It works for me but what about you
