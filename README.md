# growth mindset in my own words 
growth mindset is the the abbilty to improve to develop yourself in the learning phase
to be overall a better version of yourself and acheive higher grades or goals than you
would do while you are fixed mind afixed mind bounded to the groud cant grow or produce, a casual....

##to keep myself awar and try to keep my mindset growing:  

###first 
when i face a challenge and my brain says imposible i say to him challenge accepted

###second 
i have to try my best to the last minute and if i didn't i am worthless

###thired 
being sarcastic is the cooling system of my mind when facing hard solving problems

it works for me but i don't know about you
