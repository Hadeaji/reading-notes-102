# Introducting to git ,github and the VCS:
**VCS** stands for **Vresion Control System** which is in other words a system that can acsses the history of changes for the file.
For example if i have a test file and i amd doing changes for it before i apply them it is tracking the changes and classify them.
Whenever you want you can return to a previous copy of the file if it got corrupted or damaged so it provides utility and safty
to the programmer.

### So whats the difference between Git and GitHub:
**Git** and **GitHub** are both a **VCS** but git is located localy on everyone device and **GitHub** is on the cloud.
so, when you are working offline **Git** is tracking your work and record it, when you type the command `git status` 
in terminal you will get a status shows you the last configaration done to your file, whats is modified or not 
and whats add or deleted you can prepare files to commit by typing `git add .`
confirm your edits and to commit them by typing the command `git commit -m "here you type a message to title your changes"`


##### Now they are ready to get uploaded to the cloud
Here comes **Githud** turn, it is the same as git but it is on the internet
It is used to sparated the work between programmers in teams in a more efficient way 
so they gets the work done as fast as possible ,you can push your changes to the cloud by the command `git push origin master`
where master is the name of the branch you are using


##### It is really impressive way to insure your safty during work
